# 4.1 Backlog & Pipeline

Arenalinq separates your recruits into two main views:

**Backlog** is your master list. Every player in your workspace lives here. When you import players or add them manually, they start in the Backlog. Think of it as your pool of all known prospects.

**Pipeline** is your active recruiting board. It's organized into columns, where each column represents a stage in your evaluation process. Move players from the Backlog into your Pipeline when you're actively tracking them.
