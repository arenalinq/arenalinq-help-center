# 4.2 Pipeline Stages

Your pipeline comes with two default stages: **Backlog** and **Recruiting Queue**. From there, you can fully customize your pipeline to match how your staff actually recruits.

You can:

- **Add stages** to reflect your process (e.g., "Contacted," "Campus Visit," "Offer Extended")
- **Rename stages** to match your terminology
- **Reorder stages** to reflect the progression of your pipeline
- **Delete stages** you no longer need

:::note Scout Plan Limit
Scout plans support up to 4 custom stages. Program plans have unlimited stages.
