# 7.2 Upgrading Your Plan

To upgrade from Scout to Program:

1. Click **Settings** in the sidebar.
2. Navigate to the **Billing** section, or go directly to the **Plans** page.
3. Select the Program plan and complete the checkout.

Your upgrade takes effect immediately. You'll be able to start importing players and inviting team members right away. Billing is prorated — you'll only be charged for the remaining time in your current billing cycle.
