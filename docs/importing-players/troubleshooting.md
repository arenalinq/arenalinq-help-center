# 3.3 Troubleshooting Import Issues

### My file won't upload

Make sure it's a .csv, .xlsx, or .xls file. The file must be under 10 MB with no more than 5,000 rows.

### Columns aren't mapping correctly

You can manually adjust column mappings on the mapping screen. Arenalinq does its best to auto-match your column headers, but you can override any mapping using the dropdowns.

### Some players are missing after import

Check whether any rows were missing an email address — email is required for every player. Also check for blank rows or merged cells that may have caused rows to be skipped.

### I imported duplicates by mistake

Arenalinq automatically deduplicates by email address, so true duplicates shouldn't occur. If you're seeing near-duplicates with different email addresses, you'll need to remove them manually.

### Can I undo an import?

There is no undo for imports. If you need to clean up after an import, you can delete individual players from the overflow menu on their player detail panel.
