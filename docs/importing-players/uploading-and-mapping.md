# 3.2 Uploading & Mapping Columns

1. Navigate to the import screen.
2. Select your CSV or Excel file from your computer.
3. If your file has multiple sheets, you'll be asked to **select which sheet** to import.
4. Arenalinq will show you a **column mapping** screen. For each column in your file, select the corresponding Arenalinq field from the dropdown.
5. Preview your data to make sure everything looks right.
6. Click **"Import [count] athletes"** to add the players to your workspace. The button will show the actual number of athletes being imported.

Imported players will appear in your **Backlog**.

:::tip Deduplication
If a player with the same email address already exists in your workspace, they won't be duplicated. Email matching is case-insensitive — so `coach@school.edu` and `Coach@School.edu` are treated as the same person.
