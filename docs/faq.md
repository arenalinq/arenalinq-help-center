# 8. FAQ & Support

### How do I reset my password?

Arenalinq doesn't use passwords. Each time you sign in, you'll receive a one-time verification code via email. There's nothing to reset.

### I'm not receiving the verification code.

Check your spam or junk folder. Some institutional email systems may filter automated emails. If you're still having trouble, contact us at support@arenalinq.com.

### Can I import players from another recruiting platform?

If you can export your data as a CSV or Excel file with email addresses included, you can import it into Arenalinq using the column mapping feature. Import is available on the Program plan.

### Is my data secure?

Yes. Arenalinq takes data security seriously, especially since our platform handles information about prospective student-athletes who may be minors. We use row-level security to ensure your workspace data is isolated and only accessible by your team. Player records are protected with secure, randomly generated identifiers, and all data follows a 30-day soft-delete retention policy. No sensitive information is exposed on the client side.

### Can I delete a player from my pipeline?

Yes. Workspace owners can delete a player from the overflow menu on the player's detail panel. You'll be asked to confirm before the deletion goes through. Deleted players are retained for 30 days before permanent removal.

### Can I export my data?

Data export is not available in V1. This feature is on our roadmap.

### Can I change my conference after onboarding?

Conference selection happens during initial setup and can't be changed from the settings page. Contact us at support@arenalinq.com if you need to update it.

### How do I get help?

Email us at **support@arenalinq.com** and we'll get back to you as quickly as we can.
