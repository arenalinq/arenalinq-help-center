# 6.2 Inviting Staff (Scouts)

:::info Program Plan Only
Team collaboration is available on the **Program plan** only.
:::

You can invite members of your coaching staff to collaborate in your workspace.

1. Click **Scouts** in the sidebar.
2. Click **"Invite members"**.
3. Enter their email address.
4. They'll receive an email invitation with a link to join your workspace.

Once they accept the invitation and sign in with their OTP code, they'll have access to your shared pipeline and player data.

Program plans support up to **5 seats**. Each additional seat is billed at **$200/year**, and billing is prorated — so if you add someone mid-cycle, you only pay for the remaining time.
