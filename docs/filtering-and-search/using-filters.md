# 5.1 Using Filters

When your pipeline or backlog grows, filters help you zero in on the players you need.

Click the **"Filter"** button in the header of your Backlog or Pipeline view to open the filter panel. You can apply multiple filters at once — only players matching all active filters will be shown.

To remove filters, click **"Clear filter"** to reset your view.
