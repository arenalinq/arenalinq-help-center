# 2.1 Signing In

Arenalinq uses a one-time password (OTP) system for authentication — no passwords to remember or reset.

**To sign in:**

1. Go to your Arenalinq login page.
2. Enter the email address associated with your account.
3. Check your email for a 6-digit verification code.
4. Enter the code on the verification screen.
5. You're in.

The code expires after a short window, so enter it promptly. If you don't see the email, check your spam or junk folder. If your institution's email system is blocking the message, contact us at **support@arenalinq.com**.

:::tip
The verification code is sent every time you sign in. There's no password to manage — just your email and the code.
