# 2.2 Navigating the Dashboard

Once you sign in, you'll land on your **Backlog** — this is your default home screen where all newly added or imported players appear.

Your sidebar navigation includes:

- **Pipeline** — Your pipeline board, where you organize recruits across custom stages.
- **Backlog** — Your central list of all athletes. New imports and additions land here.
- **Scouts** — Manage your team members and invitations (Program plan).
- **Settings** — Workspace settings, billing, and account management (available to workspace owners and admins).
